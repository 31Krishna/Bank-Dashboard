Bank Dashboard Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my Bank Dashboard project built using Excel and Power BI. Itâ€™s designed to give a clear, interactive view of key banking data so you can understand trends, track performance, and make informed decisionsâ€”all in one place.

Whatâ€™s Inside

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in this project:

Excel File

 -> This is where all the raw banking data lives.

-> Includes calculations like total fees, transaction amounts, and other important metrics.

Power BI Dashboard 

  -> An interactive, easy-to-use dashboard.

  -> Features charts, graphs, and filters so you can explore the data however you like.

  -> You can drill down into branches, customer types, or time periods to get detailed insights.

Cool Features

  -> Interactive Charts & Graphs: Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and KPI cards to quickly see the numbers.

  -> Filters & Slicers: Easily narrow down the data by branch, customer type, or transaction type.

  -> Dynamic Calculations: Totals, percentages, and other calculations update automatically.

  -> Trends Over Time: See how transactions, fees, and other metrics change over months or years.

How to Use It

 -> Open the Excel file to check out the raw data and calculations.

 -> Open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop.

 -> Make sure the data source is pointing to your Excel file (so it can pull the data).

 ->Play around with the dashboardâ€”use filters, slicers, and drill-downs to explore the numbers.

Why This Dashboard Rocks

 This dashboard makes banking data easy to understand, even if youâ€™re not a data expert. Instead of sifting through hundreds of rows in Excel, you can see trends, track KPIs, and get insights instantly.
